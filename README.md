# _Dream School Finder_

Dream School Finder is a web app that uses a custom API to help NOVA students plan their transfer to four-year universities by checking GPA, completed courses, and eligibility. It addresses the theme of **Empowering Careers Through Technology** by giving students a clearer path toward their academic goals.

Our idea fulfills the **NOVA Hacks judging rubric**:

- **Idea**: Supports NOVA students through relevant, targeted tools.
- **Innovation**: Offers a unique, school-specific roadmap tool.
- **Implementation**: Includes a working demo with planned API integration.
- **Design**: Features an intuitive, student-friendly interface.
- **Video Submission**: Explained concisely in our demo video (showcased below).

## Inspiration

Many NOVA students plan to transfer to a four-year institution but struggle to navigate different pathways, especially with varying requirements between majors and schools. Our team wanted to simplify that process and empower students with tools that make academic planning more accessible and less confusing.

## Challenges We Faced

- Limited time to fully polish the backend and complete all data input.
- Adjusting the scope midway: We originally focused on first-year students but moved to a more general eligibility checker.
- Scheduling conflicts due to school, travel, and exams meant fewer coding sessions than planned.

Despite these challenges, we’re proud to have collaborated, supported each other, and created a working prototype with a clean (enough) design.
